SwiftBasket is a full-stack MERN e-commerce application built as part of my practice projects. It brings together daily essentials, fashion, lifestyle accessories, healthcare items, kids’ products, and more in a single platform.

This project is currently not production-ready — it is missing responsiveness across devices and an online payment integration. These features are on my roadmap and will be added in future iterations.

The purpose of hosting this project is to demonstrate my ability to design and develop a MERN stack application that covers essential features like product listings, cart management, and backend integration.
